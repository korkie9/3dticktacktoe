    <title>3D Tick Tack Toe</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>
      This version of tick tack toe can be conceptualised as a 3D redition of
      the original game represented on a 2D plane.
    </p>
    <p>Each 3x3 block square can be considered a layer of a cube.</p>
    <p>
      Just like in regular tick tack toe, getting three symbols in a row will
      win you the game, be it vertically, horizonally, diagonally across either
      plane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visually, this means for either plane if one player gets 3 in a row on one
      layer, just like in regular tick tack toe, that player wins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also if they get 3 in a row across the cube, they win, be it from one
      corner to the other ro from the "top" to the "bottom"
    </p>
    <p>Consider the following diagram:</p>
    <table aria-describedby="plane 1" style="margin-bottom: 5px">
      <tr>
        <th>x</th>
        <th>.</th>
        <th>.</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>.</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>.</td>
        <td>.</td>
        <td>.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <table aria-describedby="plane 2" style="margin-bottom: 5px">

        <th>x</th>
        <th>.</th>
        <th>.</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>.</td>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

        <td>.</td>
        <td>.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <table aria-describedby="plane 3" style="margin-bottom: 5px">
      <tr>
        <th>x</th>
        <th>.</th>
        <th>.</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>.</td>
        <td>.</td>
        <td>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>.</td>
        <td>.</td>
        <td>.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      In this game, X wins because they got 3 in a row going from top to bottom
      on the left backside of the cube
    </p>
    <p>Consider also:</p>
    <table aria-describedby="plane 1" style="margin-bottom: 5px">
      <tr>
        <th>X</th>
        <th>.</th>
        <th>.</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>.</td>
        <td>.</td>
        <td>.</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

        <td>.</td>
        <td>.</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <table aria-describedby="plane 2" style="margin-bottom: 5px">

        <td>0</td>
      </tr>

        <th>.</th>
        <th>.</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>.</td>
        <td>.</td>
        <td>0</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>

        <td>X</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      In this game, X wins because they placed 3 in a row from one corner of the
      cube to the other corner. Notice that a straight line can be drawn from
      one corner of the cube, through the center to the other corner of the cube
